Useful scripts
==================

This is a collection of scripts that make our lives easier. Hopefully it'd grow in the future. :)

Stuff I like to use
-------------------
  * [git-sensible](https://gitlab.com/sorsasampo/git-sensible) - Git defaults most gitters can agree on
  * [GNU Parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/) - makes life easier... if you can learn it, learn it.
  * [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) - for managing dotfiles in my home directory (... perhaps in the future, but it seems interesting)
  * [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) - an excellent graphical password manager
  * [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) - an awesome collection of Zsh addons
  * [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) - an excellent CLI password manager, uses GPG2
  * [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net) - file synchronizer. Works excellently with KeepassXC and Zim. Works with Android. Generally a must-have tool
  * [Zim](http://zim-wiki.org) - a desktop wiki. Freaking excellent to organize your notes on the Desktop
  * [Shellcheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/) - A great shell script linter
